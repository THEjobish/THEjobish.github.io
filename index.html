<h1>Here's How it Works</h1></div>

<div class="main"><h2> For Decades </h2>
<h1>I was trying supplements, workouts and diets that SORT OF worked...</h1>
After becoming a dad, I stopped working out altogether and was way over 200 LB's... I knew the only way I could even maintain or ever get back below 200 LB's would be to develop a "lazy dad workout"</p>
<ul><li>
Something that would take less than half an hour, less than five days a week, and somehow still work...</li><li>
Little did I know that, with the new supplements I began to try, I would lose 30 pounds in 90 days! And you can, too - even with a career and young children, just like I did. </li></ul></ul>
<h1>I will show you how - no subscriptions, no snake oil. All I ask is $50 and I will build you the entire stack, show you where to buy it, and tell you how to work out for maximum gains (and weight loss)!</h1>
